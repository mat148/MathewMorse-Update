        <h1>Elementarium.</h1>
        <p>What if there was a more engaging way to reach consumers that would increase brand awareness. Combining experimental browser-based 3D and Interaction Design to create a more engaging advertisement. There has been some exploration into VR advertisements with a VR headset such as oculus but that requires consumers to either own a VR headset or to go to a physical location. With my solution, I wanted to create a phone based VR that is accessible to everyone, wherever they are. As well as moving from a Graphical User Interface to a Natural User Interface.</p>

        <h1>Setting goals.</h1>
        <p>The project goals were to rethink an interaction in terms of a particular UI problem or scenario, work through ideas and solutions that are radically different, and create something that fundamentally changes how we think about our interactions with contemporary technologies.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="r-content">
        <h1>Project objective.</h1>
        <p>To achieve the project goal I created four objectives:<br>
        1. Research and be inspired by what currently exists.<br>
        2. Sketch interactions, ideas, and feelings using methods of layering and not erasing.<br>
        3. Design the workflow and interactions.<br>
        4. Finally, create an interactive prototype with Three.js.</p>

        <h1>User research.</h1>
        <p>Based on the project goals most of the research portion was focused on researching what we were interested in as well as what other people were doing in the experimental field.  So for me, that meant researching WebGL, VR, AR, interfaces, installations,  and interesting interactions.</p>

        <p>I'm really excited to keep moving forward with this project. I learned quite a lot about Natural User Interfaces, Interactions, thinking deeply about design and the design workflow, as well as developing with WebGL. I had a lot of problems I had to overcome on both the design and development side but thinking through my problems made me a better designer and developer. My final takeaway is that I highly suggest everyone try something they have never done before, it might just turn out awesome.</p>
