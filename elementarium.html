        <h1>Elementarium.</h1>
        <p>What if there was a more engaging way to reach consumers that would increase brand awareness. Combining experimental browser-based 3D and Interaction Design to create a more engaging advertisement. There has been some exploration into VR advertisements with the a VR headset such as oculus but that requires consumers to either own a VR headset or to go to a physical location. With my solution I wanted to create a phone based VR that is accessible to everyone, wherever they are. Also moving from a Graphical User Interface to a Natural User Interface.</p>

        <h1>Setting goals.</h1>
        <p>The project goals were to rethink an interaction in terms of a particular UI problem or scenario, work through ideas and solutions that are radically different, and create something that fundamentally changes how we think about our interactions with contemporary technologies.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="r-content">
        <h1>Project objective.</h1>
        <p>To achieve the project goal I created four objectives:<br>
        1. Research and be inspired by what currently exists.<br>
        2. Sketch interactions, ideas and feelings using methods of layering and not erasing.<br>
        3. Design the workflow and interactions.<br>
        4. Finally create an interactive prototype with Three.js.</p>

        <h1>User research.</h1>
        <p>Based on the project goals most of the research portion was focused on researching what we were interested in as well as what other people were doing in the experimental field.  So for me that meant researching webGL, VR, AR, interfaces, instalations,  and interesting interactions.</p>

        <p>The user experience design of this project was largely focused on designing the interactions in the 3D space.  I needed to make sure that everything was effortless and intuitive.  As well as intergrating natural user interface interactions.</p>

          <p>For the prototype I worked with Marvel to create a quick mockup that showed the features and interactions of the app. I then took that and started doing user testing to try to make sure everything was understandable, both the design and the user experience. With that feedback I've been able to make improvements. Marvel Prototype</p>

          <h2>Inspiration.</h2>
          <p>With the branding I started by trying to figure out the feeling that I would want the user to feel when using the app. I decided to convey Human, Artistic, Friendly, I wanted the user to feel safe and creative. Then I started exploring colors and fonts that conveyed this feeling. I originally started with an orange but switched to a teal to make it feel more energetic and fun. For the logo font I went with Poppins and for app / site copy I went with Open Sans, both fonts are humanist fonts so they look more friendly and human.</p>
