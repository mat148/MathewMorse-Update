        <h1>GHG.</h1>
        <p>Aviatech is a web & marketing company that tasked us to create an immersive website based experience that would assist high end traveler in locating hotels that meet their requirements and then drives the users to the hotels page to complete the sale. My solution to the problem was to create a website that was open, airy, and used big beautiful images to draw the user in and help them find the perfect location to go on a vacation.</p>

          <p>We didn't have access to the idea user which would be the high-end user.  So instead we worked as a class to create questions about what users were looking for when they went on vacation.  As well as what things they considered important when deciding which hotel to stay at.  After which I conducted user research with friends and family.</p>

        <h1>Design.</h1>
        <p>In the design phase I created a moodboard to determine the look and feel of my enviroment.  Created a mockup of the enviroment in C4D as well as creating and optimizing 3D elememnts for production.</p>

I wrote that I wanted the user to experience a sense of wonder and mystery.</p>

        <h1>Final thoughts.</h1>
        <p>I'm really excited to keep moving forward with this project. I learned quite a lot about Natural User Interfaces, Interactions, thinking deeply about design and the design workflow, as well as developing with wegGL. I had a lot of problems I had to overcome on both the design and development side but thinking through my problems made me a better designer and developer. My final take away is that I highly suggest everyone try something they have never done before, it might just turn out awesome.</p>
