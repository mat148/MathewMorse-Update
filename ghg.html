        <h1>GHG.</h1>
        <p>Aviatech is a web & marketing company that tasked us to create an immersive website based experience that would assist the high-end traveler in locating hotels that meet their requirements and then drives the users to the hotel's page to complete the sale. My solution to the problem was to create a website that was open, airy and used big beautiful images to draw the user in and help them find the perfect location to go on a vacation.</p>

        <p>Since we had a client for this project our professor wanted us to go through the entire process of user research.  We did user research and persona creation.  Looking back on all the research now, I realize how "shallow" the research was.  If I was doing this type of research now I would have done a much more in-depth analysis of everything.</p>

          <p>We didn't have access to the ideal user which would be the high-end user.  So instead we worked as a class to create questions about what users were looking for when they went on vacation.  As well as what things they considered important when deciding which hotel to stay at.  After which I conducted user research with friends and family.</p>

He goes to Google and types in greatest hotels and at the top, there is the Greatest Hotels Group website. Clicks the link and is presented with a page full of beautiful imagery of featured hotels around the world and a search box at the top. He decides to search and filter out some things to narrow down his selection. He filters by atmosphere, Services, Scenery, and Food. He wants a location that has a romantic atmosphere, pampering services, beautiful scenery and fine dining. Scott finds the perfect place in Paris, France and he takes the tour through the hotel with google business photos and falls in love with it. He then shows it to June who agrees that it is wonderful so they click “buy now”.</p>
