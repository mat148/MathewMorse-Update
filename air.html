        <h1>Air.</h1>
        <p>AIR is a exploration of taking a large ammount of data and attempting to display that in a clear and visually interesting way.  This was a two month long project for my Junior year UI class where we focused on data and interacting with that data.</p>

        <h1>Setting goals.</h1>
        <p>The goal of AIR was organize air quality data in an easy to understand way.  Taking complex data and using UI, User experience and interaction design to make the data easier to understand and interact with.</p>

        <h1>Project objective.</h1>
        <p>To achieve the projects goal I created four main objectives.  <br>1. Organize the data and interaction by sketching.  <br>2. Create wireframes and interaction design.  <br>3. Design the visual design of the app.  <br>4. Create an interactive prototype.</p>

        <h1>User research.</h1>
        <p>For user research we were asked to create a simple persona of a potientail user of our product so that we had an idea of who we would be designing for.  The only problem was that this persona was simplily an assumption of a user that was not backed up by research because of the project objectives as well as time.  Looking back on this project now I would have liked to have done usability testing as well as surveys of families who are home owners to see how much importance they give to air quality and what they currently do to monitor air quality.  Potientally families with allergies and breathing problems might be my target demographic.  After which I would have done a more in depth competitor research on other air quality management systems from high to low tech, as well as other home management systems to determine their strengths and weaknesses and find opportunites to innovate.  Finally with all of this information I would have built a more solid persona of my users.</p>

          <p>Katie and Robert recently bought a home to move their family into. They have two young children that they want to keep safe by monitoring the air quality.</p>

          <h2>Competitor research.</h2>
          <p>With the competitor research there weren't any direct competitors that I could find at the time that were montioring air quality within the home.  So I chose to look at apps that were created to monitor something within the home, wheather thats the heat or survalence cameras.  I used this research not only to see what competitors were doing but also to get inspiration for UI and data presentation.</p>

        <h1>UX design.</h1>
        <p>I spent most of my time in user experience design for this project.  Mostly sketching and quickly iterating on UI, data presentation, user flow, and interactions.  After which I finalized the interaction design.  Then creating the wireframes for each screen of the app.  Finally creating a interactive prototype with the final design assets using Html, Css, and Javascript.</p>

          <h2>Prototype.</h2>
          <p>We were tasked to create a animation to show how the application flowed. I decided to take that a step further and create an interactive prototype in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Unfortunetly due to lack of expertise and an correct estimation of my project scope I was un able to complete the prototype but fortunetly I gain valuable experience of how to tackle these types of problems in other projects. Looking back on it now I wish I knew about Jquery, Sass, or any mobile libraries to speed up my process.  But I am glad that I attempted it, this helped me better understand the ins and outs of javascript.  Unfortunetly the prototype is no longer working as it is quite old.</p>
