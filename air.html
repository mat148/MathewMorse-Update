        <h1>Air.</h1>
        <p>AIR is an exploration of taking a large amount of data and attempting to display that in a clear and visually interesting way.  This was a two-month long project for my Junior year UI class where we focused on data and interacting with that data.</p>

        <h1>Setting goals.</h1>
        <p>The goal of AIR was to organize air quality data in an easy to understand way.  Taking complex data and using UI, User experience, and interaction design to make the data easier to understand and interact with.</p>

        <h1>Project objective.</h1>
        <p>To achieve the goal of the project I created four main objectives.  <br>1. Organize the data and interaction by sketching.  <br>2. Create wireframes and interaction design.  <br>3. Design the visual design of the app.  <br>4. Create an interactive prototype.</p>

        <h1>User research.</h1>
        <p>For user research, we were asked to create a simple persona of a potential user of our product so that we had an idea of who we would be designing for.  The only problem was that this persona was simply an assumption of a user that was not backed up by research.  Looking back on this project now I would have liked to have done usability testing as well as surveys of families who are homeowners to see how much importance they give to air quality and what they currently do to monitor air quality.  Potentially families with allergies and breathing problems might be my target demographic.  After which I would have done a more in-depth competitor research on other air quality management systems from high to low tech, as well as other home management systems to determine their strengths and weaknesses and find opportunities to innovate.  Finally, with all of this information, I would have built a more solid persona of my users.</p>

          <h2>Competitor research.</h2>
          <p>With the competitor research, there weren't any direct competitors that I could find at the time that was monitoring air quality within the home.  So I chose to look at apps that were created to monitor something within the home, whether that the heat or surveillance cameras.  I used this research not only to see what competitors were doing but also to get inspiration for UI and data presentation.</p>

        <p>We were tasked to create an animation to show how the application flowed. I decided to take that a step further and create an interactive prototype in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Unfortunately due to lack of expertise and a correct estimation of my project scope I was unable to complete the prototype but fortunately I gain valuable experience of how to tackle these types of problems in other projects.</p>

So I animated everything by hand with javascript which ended up not being responsive.
